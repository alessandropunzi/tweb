Christopher Nolan reaches for the stars in Interstellar, but ends up reaching past them. At a very lengthy 2 hours 45 minutes and a moderately slow pace, Interstellar isn't the easiest stroll through the park. While the scientific plot details require focus and attention, the mystery and interest factor behind it all is more than enough to keep this film from shredding itself to pieces and floating away in various directions, like it nearly does with its final act. The visuals are pleasing, but nothing new when it comes to space. At the same time, there isn't much to overcome the storytelling. Matthew McConaughey actually carries this film on his shoulders, but a good supporting cast of Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain doesn't hurt. Interstellar is a science fiction trek to experience, if only once.
